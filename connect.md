Hi I'm Tim Welch, an accomplished and well-rounded technology lead, working with diverse clients and teams to create web applications that are a joy to use. Cutting-edge data visualization, maps, and analysis are just a few of the tools of the trade. I'm a dedicated person with an eye for detail and it gives me great satisfaction to listen to needs, study workflows, and work together to cut through complexity and develop workable and long-lasting solutions.
