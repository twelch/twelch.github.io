9 of us came together this last weekend to geek out on plants in the Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge and document them using the iNaturalist mobile app.  Thanks to my friend [Ethan](https://twitter.com/CutoffMountain) for helping spot the location, the flowers and trees were just starting to bloom.  I'll be back to pick some Elderberries later in the season :)

I must say the iNaturalist team has put together a nice little app, I'm impressed.  And if you submit incomplete observations, like if you didn't know the species name, the community jumps right in to make recommendations, sometimes within an hour!  I'll be curious to see how well their current architecture scales, so far they have over 1.2M observations.

The group was a lot of fun, the sun came out, and we had a nice little feast at the end.  Stay tuned for our next activity, ping me if you'd like to be notified.
