[This article is a work in progress during the NACIS conference]

The Milwaukee Road rail line had a long history in Minnesota.  It's official name, which tells you more about its geographic range, is the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Minneapolis Railroad.

The Milwaukee Road Depot is one train station on that line, and was a convergence for multiple train lines.   The Depot also happens to be the host of the NACIS conference this year.  This inspired me to create a map that dug deeper into this rail-focused past.

## Theme
The map is meant to show just how much rail dominated transportation into and through the 1920's.  This included larger class I railroads and streetcar lines.  There were at least 4 significant freight depots or trains stations just in the downtown Minneapolis area.

My theme broadened as I realized that NACIS, itself a network, would be hosting a convergence of people on this place, from near and far.  So the map imagines people moving from outside into the center, the arrow showing what their route of travel might have been, whether by train or streetcar.

## Disclaimers
This map has not been expert reviewed, it's based solely on online research, and in some cases my gut instinct!  It is not meant to be comprehensive or particularly accurate, but I do try.

* Roads and vehicle only river crossings were intentionally left out of the map.
* The railroad lines and streetcar tracks are not accurate in number or to a specific snapshot in time.  The intention was to focus around the peak in the 1920’s and give a feel for just how rail focused the city was.  Looking at enough maps, it’s clear that both large rail lines and streetcar lines were in flux through the 1920’s and 1930’s.  By the 1940's many of them were starting to be ripped out.  The age of rail was over.
