Through the Fire is a postcard view into the history of Pittsburgh, created for NACIS attendees. With an abundance of detail and few words, it elicits more questions than it answers.  Itâ€™s an invitation to dig deeper.

Beginning at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, the map spreads outward through time in concentric circles, from European colonization, to American Revolution and the discovery of coal. It hints that as the city grew into the steel capital of the world, its natural landscape was devastated. Then as its industrial engine faltered, large-scale urban renewal methods were used to try to clean it up.  Today, the city continues to redefine and rediscover itself.

Hints of these transitions can be seen in the density of rail, building footprints, and the type of building material used.

## Maps

This work builds upon the work of others.  Historical maps were sourced online from [Historic Pittsburgh](https://historicpittsburgh.org/pittsburgh-maps) and ESRI to represent each of the first 3 segments. In order as they appear from left to right

* Map of Pittsburgh 1835 prepared by Lewis Keyon
* Map of Pittsburgh 1889 by Sanborn and GM Hopkins
* Map of Pittsburgh 1923 by Sanborn and GM Hopkins.
* The modern day map and elements unifying all 4 time periods were created using data from OpenStreetMap contributors. [https://openstreetmap.org/copyright](https://openstreetmap.org/copyright).
