<p>My gift to NACIS attendees in 2022 is a postcard size map.  It's focused on and around the Milwaukee Road Train Depot in Minneapolis, where the conference is being held.  Shout out to a good friend, Alister Fenix who helped with edits and inspiration ðŸ˜‰

<p>The map is available for <a href='/articles/footsteps/'>print</a>, along with an article exploring what's behind the map with links to sources.

<p>It's really interesting to have made the map, and now to visit this place physically and try to match it with my mental picture I've formed.  I can see that there isn't much of the rail infrastructure left in downtown Minneapolis! Times change.  So I'm using my imagination and looking for signs and hints of what was before.  I really love doing this.

Please, let me know what you find or think or want me to know about all of this.  Disclaimer, I'm an admirer more than an expert! <a href='/'>Contact me</a> anytime.
