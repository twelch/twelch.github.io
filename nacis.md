<p>My gift to NACIS attendees in 2022 is a postcard size map.  It's focused on and around the Milwaukee Road Train Depot in Minneapolis, where the conference is being held.  Maybe I even gave you a map in-persion and you followed the link here?  Or perhaps you just stumbled upon this.  Either way, welcome.

<p>And I have a little something more for you.  The map in digital form, free to share or print for personal use.  An article delving into my process and further archive links.  And a simple interactive version of the map.  There isn't much rail infrastructure left in downtown Minneapolis, you'll have to use your imagination, and hope to stumble on some signs of what once was.

I'd love to hear what you find or think or want me to know about all this.  <a href='/'>Contact me</a> anytime.
