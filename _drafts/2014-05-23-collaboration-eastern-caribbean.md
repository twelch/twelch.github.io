# The Meeting

Back in February I attended a science forum in St. Lucia called [Developing a Shared Vision for Improving Access to Information for Protected Area Management](http://iucn.org/news_homepage/all_news_by_region/news_from_central_america/?14486/biopamaStLucia), attended by more than forty people from 13 Caribbean countries.  It was one of those rare opportunities to listen to everyone talk about their activities and their many intersections.  

One of the things I was surprised to learn is that there is at least 6 projects in the Eastern Caribbean at different stages of developing an online system to support regional activities.  Two of them are projects that I am actively starting on with Point 97. And that doesn't even count the systems being setup at the national level!  

The problem, which this forum was designed to illuminate, is that these systems were funded and planned independently, and designed to support many of the same people with the same basic needs; namely data access and support with the planning, monitoring and evaluation of marine managed areas.  Unsurprisingly, people in attendance were confused about which system was which and from what program.  They were also concerned about the prospect of having to use and support multiple overlapping systems to meet their needs.  I don't blame them.

So together we set out to figure out what to do about it, and I'm excited at the potential.  Because while these systems are independent, many of them are not designed to be black boxes.  They contain the web service building blocks that use open standards needed for connecting these systems into a whole that is stronger than their parts.

List of projects (with link), description, technology, countries working with

establish a climate resilient Eastern Caribbean Marine Managed Areas Network (ECMMAN) in cooperation with six countries.  The goal is continued development of marine protection to keep sensitive marine ecoystems intact, and my role , This German BMU-funded International Climate Initiative project The protection given to the designated areas ensures that sensitive marine ecosystems remain intact and are thus better able to withstand the stresses of climate change. Activities include enlarging and improving existing marine protected areas, promoting active involvement of the local population, and improving data and information systems as well as the network's financial and institutional sustainability.
